Select Max(years_old) from winstons_donut_logs;

What is the lowest age showing within the log?
Select Min(years_old) from winstons_donut_logs;

What is the highest amount of donuts Winston has eaten in a given period? Lowest amount? Average amount?
Select MAX(donuts_eaten) from winstons_donut_logs;
Select MIN(donuts_eaten) from winstons_donut_logs;
Select AVG(donuts_eaten) from winstons_donut_logs;
